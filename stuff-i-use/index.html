With some minor effort on top of the basic Ubuntu install, this machine handles the OS splendidly and has given a new feel to it again.<br>I have it velcroed out of sight and with lid closed, as it currently only serves to perform some basic continuous tasks.

I do not endorse many things, but ever since I have been using <a href="https://g.co/fi/r/EAW4DY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fi</a>, my mobile phone and plan became something I did not have to worry about anymore. When traveling I know I will have coverage, I know I pay the same for every byte as I pay in the US and the service‚Äôs ability to find open wireless networks ensures lowest possible monthly costs. I never felt easier to tether on the go.<br>This involves a referral link, it gives both you and me $20 credit when you use Google Fi for 30 days.
